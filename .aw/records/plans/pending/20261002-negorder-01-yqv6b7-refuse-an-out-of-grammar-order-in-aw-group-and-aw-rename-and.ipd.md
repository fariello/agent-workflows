# IPD: Refuse an out-of-grammar --order in aw group and aw rename, and make the Order substitution regex fail safe instead of silently duplicating the field

## Workflow history

- 2026-10-02 draft (opencode its_direct/pt3-claude-opus-5-1m-us): created.

## Goal

TODO: one or two sentences on what this plan achieves and why.

## Detailed Implementation Checklist (TODO)

Execution-state rule: mark an `E-*` item complete only after performing the action. That mark is not validation. Right-sizing rule: each E-item must address one concern and be executable in one focused pass; split when an E-item names multiple distinct deliverables or independent test-surfaces. Accepted execution states: blocked, failed, pending, performed; terminal gate demands 'performed'.

### Task group 1: TODO

- [ ] E-01 TODO one observable action.
  - Depends on: none
  - Expected outcome: TODO observable result.
  - Execution state: pending

Add further leaves as `- [ ] E-NEW <action>` and run `aw ipd sync` to assign ids.

## Project conventions discovered (Step 0)

- TODO: relevant conventions discovered during Step 0.
- Cite code by SYMBOL (`module.function`) or by a quoted content string, with a line number only appended to one of those and never alone: an offset expires before this plan executes (spec `ipd-structure-and-linting` Section 10.2; advisory `IPD-C801`).

## Findings

TODO: findings table or notes.

## Proposed changes (ordered, validatable)

TODO: ordered, validatable proposed changes.

## Deferred / out of scope (with reason)

TODO: deferred / out of scope, with reason (or 'none').

## Scope check

- Over-scope: none.
- Under-scope: TODO.

## Required tests / validation

TODO: how the executed plan is verified.

## Spec / documentation sync

TODO: specs/docs to update, or 'N/A with reason'.

## Open questions

### OQ-01: TODO a question

- Blocking: no
- Status: open
- Owner: none
- Resolution or deferral rationale: TODO.

## Validation and cross-check (verify before reporting done)

Validation-state rule: inspect evidence in a separate pass. Do not mark a `V-*` item complete from memory or from the matching execution checkmark. Accepted validation results: blocked, failed, pass, pending; terminal gate demands 'pass'.

- [ ] V-01 validates E-01
  - Required evidence: TODO falsifiable evidence.
  - Observed evidence:
  - Result: pending

## Approval and execution gate

- Size assessment: standard
- Cohesion rationale: not required

TODO: approval + execution gate prose (execution contract, post-gate lifecycle move).
