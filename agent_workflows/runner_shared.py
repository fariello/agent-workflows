"""The ONE shared library for the two host runners (rununify Order 02, `818uru`).

`oc_runipd` (the OpenCode driver) and `agy_runipd` (the Antigravity driver) are near-duplicate
programs. Measured at HEAD `1ecc5891`: 86 top-level symbols are defined in BOTH, and only 33 of them
are AST-identical while 50 have DRIFTED. This module is the home for the identical ones, so each has
exactly one definition and a fix to it reaches both drivers.

WHY THE IDENTICAL SET IS THE DANGEROUS SET, since "identical" sounds like "harmless". Two identical
copies have no behavioral disagreement TODAY, which is exactly why nothing signals when one is edited
and the other is not; that is how the 50 currently-diverged symbols got that way. The cost is
already visible in this package's history: `DriverError` was defined TWICE as two DISTINCT classes,
so `agy_runipd` needed a hand-written wrapper to translate one into the other before its `main` could
catch a preflight refusal raised from the OpenCode code path.

# ---- THE ADMISSION RULE -------------------------------------------------------------------------

A symbol belongs here only if BOTH runners' definitions were PROVEN identical by AST comparison
(`ast.dump(ast.parse(ast.unparse(node)), include_attributes=False)`), never merely judged similar by
reading. `tests/test_runner_shared.py` holds the pre-move fingerprint of every symbol below and
FAILS if a body drifted from what was moved.

State the rule precisely, because the obvious wording is FALSE one screen further down: it is
"identical bodies MODULO AN EXPLICITLY INJECTED DEPENDENCY", not "identical bodies verbatim". Some
symbols here call a symbol that STAYS in the runners, either because it is host-specific or because
it is DIVERGED and deciding which side wins belongs to a later plan. Those take the dependency as an
explicit PARAMETER, and each runner keeps a one-line wrapper at the original name and signature that
binds its own. The complete list is enumerated below; an unenumerated injection is a defect rather
than a judgment call, and `tests/test_runner_shared.py` pins the list so it cannot grow silently.

WHAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN HERE, and why each prohibition exists rather than just that it does:

  * This module MUST NOT import either runner, at module level or lazily inside a function. The
    import cycle is the lesser reason. The real one is that importing a DIVERGED symbol from one
    runner into shared code would silently give BOTH drivers that runner's behavior, which is a
    behavior change wearing a de-duplication's clothes. `tests/test_runner_shared.py` asserts the
    absence by AST, so the rule is enforced and not merely documented.
  * NO module-level mutable state. A registration seam ("each runner registers its own
    `write_report` at import time") was considered for the injected dependencies and DECLINED by the
    maintainer: process-global state makes behavior depend on import ORDER and leaks between tests.
    A parameter is passed at the call, so there is nothing to register and nothing to leak.
  * A symbol whose bodies DIFFER belongs to a later child of the `rununify` Set, not here. Moving a
    diverged symbol requires first deciding which side is authoritative, with evidence, and that
    decision is the intellectual work this module is deliberately NOT doing.

Per the orchestrator's OQ-02, this is the shared runner library and `plan_readiness.py` is a
DESIGNATED peer it may import, NOT something it absorbs: `status_set.py` and `ipd_schema.py` import
`plan_readiness` too, and they are not runners.

# ---- INJECTED DEPENDENCIES (the complete list) --------------------------------------------------

Five symbols call something that stays behind. Each takes it as a keyword-only parameter; each runner
wraps it at the original name and signature, so NO call site in either runner was rewritten. The
parenthetical says why the dependency could not simply move too:

  * `run_checked(..., env_builder=)`         <- `pinned_child_env`   (opencode-only, host-specific)
  * `save_state(..., write_report=)`         <- `write_report`       (DIVERGED)
  * `discover_plans(..., parse_plan_file=)`  <- `parse_plan_file`    (DIVERGED; and it is also what
                                                 constructs each runner's OWN `PlanRecord`, which are
                                                 different NamedTuples - oc's carries a `kind` field
                                                 agy's lacks - so injecting the parser is what keeps
                                                 each driver's record type its own)
  * `validate_manifest(..., parse_dependency_token=)`               (opencode-only)
  * `print_status(..., driver_label=)`       <- the host's own name  (the sole host-naming-only symbol
                                                 of the 34: the two bodies differed ONLY by the
                                                 literal 'opencode' vs 'antigravity')

TWO SYMBOLS THAT COULD NOT MOVE AT ALL, recorded here because a reader comparing this module against
the plan's 34-symbol manifest will otherwise think they were forgotten:

  * `disable_lane_prompt` MUTATES a module-level `_LANE_PROMPT_DISABLED` flag through `global`. A
    shared `global` would write THIS module's flag while each runner's `_lane_reclaim_prompt`
    (DIVERGED, so it stays behind) kept reading its OWN, and prompt suppression on a repeated
    interrupt would silently stop working - a regression whose only symptom is an unattended run
    stopping to ask a question nobody is there to answer. It stays defined in both runners, and
    `tests/test_runner_shared.py::UnmovableSymbolTests` pins that reason so it is not "finished"
    later by someone who reads the count and not the constraint.
  * `_read_set`/`_read_order`/`describe_unresolved_plan_selector`/`validate_manifest` close over the
    module constants `_SET_RE`, `_ORDER_RE`, `ID6_RE` and `SCHEMA_VERSION`. Those four constants are
    themselves byte-identical in both runners, so they MOVE here rather than being injected, and each
    runner re-exports them so its other call sites are untouched.

Conventions follow `host_runner.py`: a docstring stating what the module owns and its design posture,
banner comments per section, and no import of a caller.
